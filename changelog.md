2016-02-29 21:05 Finished DCT, Quantization, ZigZag and RLE for saving the data. This took a lot of time, and I will now start on motion vectors.
2016-02-07 23:27 Added RGB->YCrCb. Need to add more methods to allow me to view Y, Cr & Cb seperately and check that it is all working. YCrCb->RGB is not working. Double check this. Also update the GUI to tab between the different types of the image planes (Y, Cr, Cb).
2016-02-09 14:58 RGB->YCbCr->RGB working. Now starting on sampling.
